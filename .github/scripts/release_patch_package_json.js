 * - name
 * - version
 * - description
 * - author
 * - license
 * - homepage
 * - repository
 * - bugs
 * - keywords
 * - dependencies
 * - devDependencies
 * 
 * For beta packages, the version number is updated to include a beta suffix.
 * 
 * The new package.json file is written to the lib folder, which is the folder that will be packed and published to npm.
 * For beta packages, the original package.json file is also temporarily updated with the new beta version number so that
 * the version number in the registry is correct and matches the tarball.
